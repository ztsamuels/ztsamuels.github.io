               my name is zoe and i'm an aspriring robotics engineer. even though that's what i want to do with my life, 
               i've also taken the time to pursue other interests. i have a little experience with html, css, and 
               javascript. i have a lot of experience with scratch, and have created a few games through that. 
               outside of that i like to make comic book edits, write, and play music.

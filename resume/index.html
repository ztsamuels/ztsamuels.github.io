			<h1>Summary</h1>
			<p>I'm a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, and philanthropist. 
			   I led the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century and 
			   became one of the richest Americans in history. I also became a leading philanthropist 
			   in the United States and in the British Empire. During the last 18 years of his life, I 
			   gave away about $350 million to charities, foundations, and universities – almost 90 
			   percent of his fortune. My 1889 article proclaiming "The Gospel of Wealth" called on 
			   the rich to use their wealth to improve society, and stimulated a wave of philanthropy.</p>
